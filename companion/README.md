## Companion Container

The companion container facilitates message transmission and reception through two HTTP endpoints, leveraging the RabbitMQ broker:
* `/post_message`
* `/get_message`

For usage demonstrations, refer to the following examples:
* <a href="https://github.com/f-coda/Stream-Processing/blob/main/operator/Interface.py">Post request example</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/f-coda/Stream-Processing/blob/main/operator/dummy_operator.py">Get request example</a>

When a new pod is deployed on our platform, it incorporates both the function container provided by the developer and a specialized companion container. The accompanying figure illustrates the basic scenario featuring two operatorsâ€”one for sending messages and the other for receiving them. Additionally, our platform supports operators capable of both sending and receiving messages.
