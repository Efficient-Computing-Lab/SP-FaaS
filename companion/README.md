## Description

The companion container facilitates message transmission and reception through two HTTP endpoints, leveraging the RabbitMQ broker:
* `/post_message`: This method invokes the <mark>publish_message(data,topic)</mark> function from the 
<a href=https://github.com/f-coda/Stream-Processing/blob/main/companion/publish.py>publish.py</a> script to send a message to the specified topic.
* `/get_message`: This method calls the <mark>consume_message(topic)</mark> function from the 
<a href=https://github.com/f-coda/Stream-Processing/blob/main/companion/consume.py>consumer.py</a> script to prefetch 10 messages from the designated topic. It then sends these messages back to the operator one by one.

The <mark>publish_message</mark> and <mark>consume_message</mark> functions reference the topic parameter, which is initialized by the environment variable named <mark>OUTPUT_TOPIC</mark> in the
<a href=https://github.com/f-coda/Stream-Processing/blob/main/companion/Interface.py>Interface.py</a> script. This naming convention is based on the concept that when an operator writes to a queue, it signifies an output, and when it reads from the queue, it represents an input. Similarly, there is also a topic named <mark>INPUT_TOPIC</mark> for the consumption scenario.

For usage demonstrations of the endpoints, refer to the <a href=https://github.com/f-coda/Stream-Processing/blob/main/operator/>operator</a> directory

## Deployment
When a new pod is deployed on our platform, it incorporates both the function container provided by the developer and a specialized companion container. The accompanying figure illustrates the basic scenario featuring two operatorsâ€”one for sending messages and the other for receiving them. Additionally, our platform supports operators capable of both sending and receiving messages.
