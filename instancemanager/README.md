## Instance Manager

The Instance Manager functions as a service capable of initiating processes when prompted via the <mark>/init</mark> endpoint within the <mark>receive_data()</mark> function of the <a href=https://github.com/f-coda/Stream-Processing/blob/main/instancemanager/main.py>main.py</a> script. These processes are designed to retrieve data from reported topics. Essentially, these processes act as subscribers to result topics located on separate vhosts. Each vhost hosts multiple result topics, corresponding to the output of different operators. Notably, the Instance Manager specifically monitors output topics associated with operators that have at least one scaling rule in place.
