## Instance Manager

The Instance Manager functions as a service capable of initiating processes when prompted via the `/init` endpoint within the `receive_data()` function of the <a href=https://github.com/f-coda/Stream-Processing/blob/main/instancemanager/main.py>main.py</a> script. These processes are designed to retrieve data from reported queues. Essentially, these processes act as subscribers to result termination queues located on separate vhosts. Each vhost host has one termination queue, in which operators should report if they have finished their operation.
