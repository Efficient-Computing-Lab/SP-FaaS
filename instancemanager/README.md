## Instance Manager

The Instance Manager functions as a service capable of initiating processes when prompted via the `/init` endpoint within the `receive_data()` function of the <a href=https://github.com/f-coda/Stream-Processing/blob/main/instancemanager/main.py>main.py</a> script. These processes are designed to retrieve data from reported queues. Essentially, these processes act as subscribers to result queues located on separate vhosts. Each vhost hosts multiple result queues, corresponding to the output of different operators. Notably, the Instance Manager specifically monitors output queues associated with operators that have at least one scaling rule in place.
